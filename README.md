# Fine-Tuning GPT-2 for Custom Text Generation

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a GPT-2 model for generating custom text. It includes detailed steps for setting up your environment, preparing datasets, training the model, and evaluating text generation performance.

## Features

- Fine-tune GPT-2 on your own dataset
- Generate text based on customized prompts
- Evaluate generated text for coherence, relevance, and creativity

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `transformers`
- `datasets`
- `torch`
- `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`

Install them via pip:
```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch scipy scikit-learn
```

### Setup

1. **Prepare Dataset**: Save your text data in a file named `sample_data.txt`.

2. **Training the Model**:
   - Modify and run the training script to fine-tune GPT-2 using your dataset.

3. **Generate Text**:
   - Use the provided script to generate text based on prompts.

4. **Evaluate Performance**:
   - Assess coherence, relevance, and creativity of the generated text.

## Scripts

- `train_model.py`: Contains code for training the GPT-2 model.
- `generate_text.py`: Script to generate text using the fine-tuned model.
- `evaluate_performance.py`: Script for evaluating text coherence, relevance, and creativity.

## Example Output

Generated Text:
```
Fine-tuning models can help them perform better on tasks.
```

Coherence Similarity: 0.9468  
Relevance Similarity: 0.4222  
Creativity Entropy: 3.1699
